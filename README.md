Update 1/8/2015: This plugin is obsolete and unused on Avicus. Anyone is welcome to use its code.

Leap
====

Jump to the sky, with this Avicus Bukkit plugin for double jumping! Right now, this plugin will only function on Avicus servers as it utilizes various libraries from Avicus. You use my code in this repository in any way, I don't care. If you can port it to a server without the Avicus library, I applaud you.

Trails can be given to players with the permission: "leap.trail.NAME"

Possible Trails:

* Cloud
* Critical
* Ember
* Ender
* Explosion
* Fire
* Heart
* Portal
* Rainbow
* Runes
* Slime
* Snow
* Void
